# Salesforce CQRS

Command-Query Responsibility Segregation, or CSRQ, provides the ability to separate Query from Commands responsibilities using SOLID Principles. Queries retrieve information from a sink (data store) for the user. A command performs a task, such as update a sink (data store). Commands mutate state, while a Query does not. Technically, a Command does not return a value; however, the example
which follows will return status. Each provides a single responsibility (Liskov principle in soLid).
